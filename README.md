# Udacity-build-a-potfolio

Part 1: Web Foundations
Project 2: Build a Portfolio Site
This project is a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It is uploaded on GitHub as a separate repository for grading purposes.

I've decided not to use any framework like Bootstrap so I can practice coding with plain HTML and CSS.
